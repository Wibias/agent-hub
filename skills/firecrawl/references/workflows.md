## Path C: Repeatable Deliverables

Use this when the goal is a finished artifact powered by Firecrawl web
data — a research brief, SEO audit, QA report, lead list, knowledge
base, competitive intel digest, or a cloned design system — not raw web
extraction and not product-code integration.

Workflow skills infer from context first and only ask short clarifying
questions when an input would block the work. They also call out
independently parallelizable units so sub-agents can fan out across
competitors, pages, or sources.

Start with the umbrella `firecrawl-workflows` skill — it inspects the
user's request and routes to the right workflow (research, SEO, lead
gen, QA, knowledge base, design clone, and others). If the agent
already knows which workflow to run, hand off to that workflow skill
directly.

The full skill list lives in the [workflows repo](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-workflows).

Default flow for workflow deliverables:

1. confirm the workflow and final artifact with the user
2. collect web evidence with Firecrawl through the CLI or equivalent tool surface
3. save or cite source evidence so claims are traceable
4. run independent research units in parallel when available
5. synthesize findings into the requested deliverable
6. include a short "rerun inputs" block when the workflow could be automated

If the underlying web work fails or the request shifts to "wire Firecrawl into product code," switch to Path A or Path B.

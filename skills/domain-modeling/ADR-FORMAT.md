# ADR Format

## Existing repository convention first

Before creating an ADR, inspect repository evidence for an established convention: existing ADR/decision directories, naming/numbering patterns, file extension/markup, headings, `.adr-dir`, ADR tooling, and project instructions.

An established repository convention overrides the Hub default below. Continue its location, numbering and section shape rather than introducing a second ADR system. If evidence conflicts, surface the conflict instead of silently choosing one.

The rest of this file is the **default only when no repository convention exists**.

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why* — not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) — useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan the selected ADR directory for the highest existing number and increment by one. Do not restart numbering when the repository already has a sequence.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR.

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library — just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it so the same debate is not restarted without new evidence.
